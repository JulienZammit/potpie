        You have access to the following tools:

        <tools_help>
        {tools_help}
        </tools_help>

        Now, consider the user's prompt:

        <user_prompt>
        {query}
        </user_prompt>

        Here is the relevant project information:

        <project_id>{self.project_id}</project_id>

        <node_ids>{node_ids}</node_ids>

        Your task is as follows:

        <task_description>
        {task_config.description}
        </task_description>

        You have a maximum of <max_iterations>{self.max_iter}</max_iterations> iterations to complete this task.

        Before proceeding with the task, conduct a thorough project analysis inside <project_analysis> tags. Consider the following:
        1. Analyze the project structure and identify key components.
        2. Break down the user's prompt and extract main objectives.
        3. List out the available tools and their potential applications for this task.
        4. Prioritize subtasks based on their importance and dependencies.
        5. Identify the most efficient way to use the provided tools.

Change: Addition of a new feature flag/config parameter "pilled_cross_sell_widget" to the existing comma-separated list in the environment variable XP_CONFIG_PARAMS.\n\n- Category: Business logic update (feature flag/configuration change affecting feature toggling)\n- Endpoint/Function/Component: XP_AB_SERVER_URL related feature toggling/configuration system; specifically impacts the checkout service\'s feature flag evaluation for cross-sell widgets.\n- New Behavior: The system now includes a new experimental or feature-flagged variant "pilled_cross_sell_widget" as part of the XP (experimentation/feature flag) configuration parameters. This likely enables or controls a new variant or UI/UX behavior related to cross-sell widgets in the checkout flow.\n- Test Implications:\n  - Tests need to verify that the new feature flag "pilled_cross_sell_widget" is recognized and correctly toggled by the system.\n  - Validation that enabling/disabling this flag affects the checkout behavior as expected.\n  - Regression tests to ensure no disruption to existing XP_CONFIG_PARAMS features.\n  - Potential testing of UI changes or business logic changes triggered by this flag.\n- Downstream Dependencies: Any service or component that reads or interprets XP_CONFIG_PARAMS for feature toggling, especially those related to cross-sell widgets in the checkout flow.\n- Modified Inputs: XP_CONFIG_PARAMS environment variable now includes an additional flag "pilled_cross_sell_widget".\n- Modified Outputs: None directly from this file; indirect effect on feature toggling behavior.\n- Context Needed: Code or configuration that reads and acts upon XP_CONFIG_PARAMS, especially feature flag evaluation logic for cross-sell widgets; checkout UI or backend components that consume this flag.\n\nSummary: The only change is the addition of a new feature flag "pilled_cross_sell_widget" to the XP_CONFIG_PARAMS environment variable, enabling a new variant or feature related to cross-sell widgets in the checkout service.\n\nNo other changes or modifications to endpoints, API parameters, or business logic are present in this diff.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: [environment configuration file]\nChange Type: Business logic update (feature flag/configuration change)\nSummary: Added a new feature flag "pilled_cross_sell_widget" to the XP_CONFIG_PARAMS environment variable to enable a new cross-sell widget variant in the checkout service.\nEndpoint/Function: Feature flag evaluation component consuming XP_CONFIG_PARAMS; checkout service cross-sell widget feature\nNew Behavior: The checkout service will now recognize and potentially activate the "pilled_cross_sell_widget" feature flag, enabling new cross-sell widget behavior or UI variant.\nTest Impact: Medium\nDownstream Dependencies: Feature flag evaluation logic, checkout cross-sell widget components (UI/backend)\nModified Inputs: XP_CONFIG_PARAMS environment variable (added "pilled_cross_sell_widget")\nModified Outputs: None directly; indirect changes in feature toggling behavior\nContext Needed: Feature flag evaluation code, checkout cross-sell widget implementation, XP server integration\nSuggested Test Scenarios:\n- Verify that the "pilled_cross_sell_widget" flag is correctly parsed and recognized by the feature flag system.\n- Test checkout flows with the flag enabled and disabled to confirm expected behavior changes.\n- Regression test existing XP_CONFIG_PARAMS flags to ensure no side effects.\n- Validate UI rendering and backend logic changes related to cross-sell widgets when the flag is active.\n- Edge case: Behavior when the flag is malformed or missing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1.

This could enable new UI elements or business logic related to cross-selling items in the checkout flow.\n- Modified inputs: The environment variable `XP_CONFIG_PARAMS` now includes an additional flag `pilled_cross_sell_widget`.\n- Modified outputs: No direct output change in this file, but downstream services or components that read `XP_CONFIG_PARAMS` will behave differently.\n- Downstream dependencies: Any service or component that reads `XP_CONFIG_PARAMS` to enable/disable features, especially those related to cross-sell widgets or checkout UI/logic.\n- Test implications: \n  - Tests need to verify that the new feature flag `pilled_cross_sell_widget` is correctly recognized and toggled.\n  - Functional tests should cover scenarios where this flag is enabled and disabled.\n  - Regression tests to ensure existing XP_CONFIG_PARAMS flags continue to work as expected.\n  - Integration tests to verify that cross-sell widget behavior changes according to this flag.\n  - Edge cases where the flag is missing, malformed, or combined with other flags.\n- No API, data model, or security changes are evident from this diff.\n- No direct UI code changes shown here, but the flag likely impacts UI behavior downstream.\n- No error handling or performance changes are indicated.\n\nSummary: This change introduces a new feature flag `pilled_cross_sell_widget` to the XP configuration parameters, potentially enabling a new cross-sell widget feature in the checkout experience.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: [environment configuration file]\nChange Type: Business logic update (feature flag addition)\nSummary: Added a new feature flag `pilled_cross_sell_widget` to the XP configuration parameters to enable or test a new cross-sell widget feature.\nEndpoint/Function: XP_AB_SERVER_URL / XP_CONFIG_PARAMS feature flag configuration (affects checkout cross-sell widget behavior)\nNew Behavior: The system will now consider the `pilled_cross_sell_widget` flag in its feature toggling logic, potentially enabling new cross-sell widget functionality in checkout flows.\nTest Impact: Medium\nDownstream Dependencies: Components/services that read and act on `XP_CONFIG_PARAMS` flags, especially checkout and cross-sell related modules.\nModified Inputs: XP_CONFIG_PARAMS environment variable (added `pilled_cross_sell_widget`)\nModified Outputs: None directly in this file; downstream behavior changes expected.\nContext Needed: Functions or modules that parse and use `XP_CONFIG_PARAMS` flags, especially those controlling cross-sell widgets or checkout UI features.\nSuggested Test Scenarios:\n- Verify that the system correctly detects and enables the `pilled_cross_sell_widget` flag.\n- Test checkout flows with the flag enabled and disabled to observe differences in cross-sell widget behavior.\n- Validate that other XP_CONFIG_PARAMS flags continue to function as expected.\n- Test system behavior when the flag is missing or malformed.\n- Regression tests for checkout and cross-sell features to ensure no unintended side effects.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of new feature flag constants related to "Pilled Cross Sell Widget":\n   - New constants added:\n     - PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_SKIP_XP\n     - PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_DEFAULT_VARIANT\n     - PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_DEFAULT_VARIANT_DEFAULT_VALUE ("non_tabbed")\n     - PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_VARIANT ("tabbed")\n     - PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_ENABLED_USER_IDS\n\n   Category: Business logic update (feature flag and variant handling)\n\n2. Addition of two new public methods related to the "Pilled Cross Sell Widget":\n   - isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped():\n     - Returns a boolean indicating if the XP call for the pilled cross sell widget should be skipped.\n     - Reads from the checkoutOptions feature flag PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_SKIP_XP with default false.\n\n   - getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant(String customerId):\n     - Returns a String representing the default variant for the pilled cross sell widget.\n     - Checks if the given customerId is in a whitelist (PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_ENABLED_USER_IDS).\n     - If whitelisted, returns "tabbed" variant.\n     - Otherwise, returns the configured default variant or the default value "non_tabbed".\n\n   Category: Business logic update (feature flag evaluation and variant selection)\n\n3. Functional impact:\n   - These methods introduce a new feature toggle and variant selection logic for a "pilled cross sell widget" feature.\n   - The logic includes:\n     - Ability to skip XP evaluation for this widget.\n     - Variant selection based on user whitelist or default configuration.\n   - This affects how the UI or business logic might render or behave for cross-sell widgets in the cart or checkout flow.\n\n4. Test implications:\n   - New feature flag behavior needs to be tested:\n     - When XP call is skipped (true) vs not skipped (false).\n   - Variant selection logic:\n     - For whitelisted user IDs, the variant should be "tabbed".\n     - For non-whitelisted users, the variant should be the configured default or fallback to "non_tabbed".\n   - Edge cases:\n     - Null or empty customerId.\n     - Empty or malformed whitelist.\n     - Missing or empty default variant config.\n   - Integration with XP platform calls if applicable (though skipping XP is a boolean flag).\n   - Impact on UI rendering or business logic that consumes these methods.\n\n5. Downstream dependencies:\n   - These new methods do not call other functions within this file.\n   - They rely on checkoutOptions to fetch configuration values.\n   - Utility methods used: Utility.isNotEmpty (for customerId check).\n   - No changes to parameters or return types of existing methods.\n\n6. Modified inputs/outputs:\n   - New method getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant takes String customerId as input.\n   - Returns String variant name.\n   - isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped returns boolean, no inputs.\n\n7. No API signature changes or data model changes.\n8. No error handling or performance changes.\n9. No direct UI code changes visible here, but this likely affects UI rendering downstream.\n\n10. Context needed for further testing:\n    - Where and how these methods are called in the application (e.g., UI components, cart rendering).\n    - The XP platform integration for cross sell widgets.\n    - The configuration management for checkoutOptions (how flags are set).\n    - Any UI or service code that consumes the variant returned by getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: FeatureFlagService.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update  \nSummary: Added feature flags and methods to control skipping XP calls and variant selection for a new "pilled cross sell widget" feature.  \nEndpoint/Function:  \n- isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped()  \n- getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant(String customerId)  \n\nNew Behavior:  \n- Ability to skip XP evaluation for the pilled cross sell widget via a feature flag.  \n- Variant selection for the widget based on whether the user is whitelisted (returns "tabbed") or else returns a configured default variant or fallback default ("non_tabbed").  \n\nTest Impact: Medium  \n\nDownstream Dependencies:  \n- checkoutOptions.getOptionAsBoolean  \n- checkoutOptions.getOption  \n- Utility.isNotEmpty  \n\nModified Inputs:  \n- getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant(String customerId)  \n\nModified Outputs:  \n- isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped() returns boolean  \n- getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant() returns String variant  \n\nContext Needed:  \n- Usage locations of these methods in the application (UI or service layers)  \n- Configuration of checkoutOptions for these new flags  \n- XP platform integration related to cross sell widgets  \n- UI rendering logic for cross sell widgets  \n\nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped returns correct boolean based on feature flag.  \n- Verify getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant returns "tabbed" for whitelisted user IDs.  \n- Verify getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant returns configured default variant when user is not whitelisted.  \n- Verify fallback to "non_tabbed" default variant when no config is set.  \n- Test behavior with null, empty, or invalid customerId.  \n- Test behavior with empty or missing whitelist.  \n- Test integration with UI rendering or business logic that consumes these methods.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Change: Addition of a new import for `CrossSellTab` and modification of the fallback and exception handling return statements in `cartSuggestions` and `cartSuggestionFallback` methods to include an additional parameter - an empty list of `CrossSellTab`.\n   - Category: API change, Data model change, Error handling change\n   - Endpoint/Function affected: `cartSuggestions` method and `cartSuggestionFallback` method in `CartSuggestionController`\n   - New Behavior: Previously, when an exception occurred or the Hystrix fallback was triggered, the response returned by `generateSuggestionsResponse` included only a boolean flag and an empty list of `CrossSellSuggestionV2`. Now, the response also includes an empty list of `CrossSellTab`. This implies that the API response structure has been extended to include an additional data model element (`CrossSellTab`), even in failure/fallback scenarios.\n   - Test Implications:\n     - Tests must verify that the API response now consistently includes the new `CrossSellTab` list in all cases, including success, failure, and fallback.\n     - Validation of the response schema must be updated to include this new field.\n     - Tests for fallback and error scenarios must confirm that the new field is present and correctly initialized (empty list).\n     - Potential backward compatibility tests to ensure clients handle the extended response properly.\n   - Downstream Dependencies: \n     - `generateSuggestionsResponse` method (imported statically from `CrossSellSuggestionHelper`) is modified to accept and handle the additional `CrossSellTab` parameter.\n     - `crossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestion` remains unchanged in this file but is the main service call.\n   - Modified Inputs/Parameters: None in the controller method signature or request input.\n   - Modified Outputs/Return Values: The `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` now includes an additional list of `CrossSellTab` in the response payload.\n   - Additional Notes: The change is limited to the controller layer\'s error/fallback response construction; no changes to the main successful service call or request handling are visible here.\n\nSummary:\n- The main functional change is the extension of the API response structure to include an additional data model element (`CrossSellTab`), particularly in fallback and error scenarios.\n- This affects the contract of the `/api/v1/cart/suggestions` POST endpoint.\n- Testing must be updated to validate this extended response structure and ensure consistent behavior across success, failure, and fallback paths.\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CartSuggestionController.java  \nChange Type: API change, Data model change, Error handling change  \nSummary: The API response for cart suggestions now includes an additional `CrossSellTab` list in fallback and error responses.  \nEndpoint/Function: `/api/v1/cart/suggestions` POST endpoint, specifically `cartSuggestions` and `cartSuggestionFallback` methods.  \nNew Behavior: On failure or fallback, the response includes an empty list of `CrossSellTab` alongside the existing empty list of `CrossSellSuggestionV2`, extending the response schema.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `generateSuggestionsResponse` (from `CrossSellSuggestionHelper`), `crossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestion`  \nModified Inputs: None  \nModified Outputs: `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` now contains an additional list of `CrossSellTab` in error and fallback responses.  \nContext Needed:  \n- Implementation of `generateSuggestionsResponse` in `CrossSellSuggestionHelper` to understand how the new parameter is handled.  \n- Definition and usage of `CrossSellTab` data model.  \n- `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` class definition to confirm schema changes.  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify successful response still returns expected data (no change visible here, but good to confirm).  \n- Verify error scenario response includes empty `CrossSellSuggestionV2` list and empty `CrossSellTab` list.  \n- Verify fallback scenario response includes empty `CrossSellSuggestionV2` list and empty `CrossSellTab` list.  \n- Validate response schema includes `CrossSellTab` field and is correctly serialized.  \n- Confirm that metrics increment on failure as before.  \n- Test client handling of the extended response schema for backward compatibility.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new field `crossSellWidgetData` of type `CrossSellWidgetData` to the `Cart` class.\n\n- Category: Data model change (schema)\n- Component affected: `Cart` data model class used in the cart API responses and internal representations.\n- New behavior: The `Cart` object now includes an additional property `cross_sell_widget_data` which holds data related to cross-selling widgets. This likely means the cart response or internal cart representation can carry cross-sell related UI or business data.\n- Test implications:\n  - Serialization/deserialization tests need to verify the new field is correctly handled in JSON input/output.\n  - Backward compatibility tests to ensure older clients or services not expecting this field do not break.\n  - Functional tests to verify that when `crossSellWidgetData` is populated, the cart behaves as expected (e.g., cross-sell UI widgets appear or cross-sell logic triggers).\n  - Validation tests to ensure that invalid or missing `crossSellWidgetData` does not cause failures.\n  - Integration tests to ensure that the upstream services populating this field and downstream consumers using it work correctly.\n- Downstream dependencies: No functions are directly modified or called in this diff; this is purely a data model addition.\n- Modified inputs/parameters: None explicitly modified; however, the serialized JSON representation of `Cart` now includes a new optional field.\n- Modified outputs/return values: `Cart` JSON responses now may include `cross_sell_widget_data`.\n- Context needed: The definition and usage of `CrossSellWidgetData` class, any services or endpoints that populate or consume this field, and any UI components rendering cross-sell widgets.\n\nSummary: The only change is the addition of a new data model field `crossSellWidgetData` to the `Cart` class to support cross-selling widget data.\n\nNo other changes or business logic updates are present in the diff.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: com/swiggy/api/data/model/cart/presenter/Cart.java  \nChange Type: Data model change (schema)  \nSummary: Added a new field `crossSellWidgetData` to the `Cart` class to include cross-selling widget data in the cart representation.  \nEndpoint/Function: Cart data model class used in cart-related APIs and services  \nNew Behavior: The `Cart` object now optionally contains cross-sell widget data, enabling the cart to carry information needed for cross-selling UI or business logic.  \nTest Impact: Medium (due to serialization, backward compatibility, and integration considerations)  \nDownstream Dependencies: None visible in this file (no functions called or modified)  \nModified Inputs: None explicitly; JSON input may now include `cross_sell_widget_data`  \nModified Outputs: JSON output of `Cart` may now include `cross_sell_widget_data`  \nContext Needed:  \n- `CrossSellWidgetData` class definition and usage  \n- Services or endpoints that populate or consume `crossSellWidgetData`  \n- UI components or business logic that use cross-sell widget data  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Serialization/deserialization of `Cart` with and without `crossSellWidgetData`  \n- Backward compatibility tests with clients not expecting this field  \n- Functional tests verifying cart behavior when `crossSellWidgetData` is present  \n- Validation tests for malformed or missing `crossSellWidgetData`  \n- Integration tests covering upstream and downstream usage of this new field\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1.

Addition of error handling and logging in `populateCrossSellWidgetData` method:\n   - Logs errors and increments failure metrics if exceptions occur.\n   - Category: Error handling change.\n   - Implication: Tests should cover failure scenarios and verify metrics/logging behavior.\n\nSummary of impact:\n- New cross-sell widget data integration into cart presentation.\n- New data models and transformation logic for cross-sell suggestions.\n- Metrics tracking for cross-sell data population success/failure.\n- Changes primarily affect cart presentation logic and response structure.\n\nDownstream dependencies (functions called by changed code):\n- `convertCrossSellItemToCartMenuItem`\n- `CheckoutCustomMetrics.CROSS_SELL_SUGGESTIONS_METRICS.labels().inc()`\n- `cart.setCrossSellWidgetData()`\n\nModified inputs/parameters:\n- `BaseCart` now expected to potentially contain `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` with cross-sell data.\n\nModified outputs/return values:\n- `Cart` object now includes a new field `crossSellWidgetData` populated with cross-sell tabs and items.\n\nPotential test implications:\n- Verify that when `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` is present with cross-sell suggestions, the cart response includes correctly populated `crossSellWidgetData`.\n- Verify behavior when cross-sell suggestions are empty or null.\n- Verify correct mapping of cross-sell suggestion fields to cart item fields.\n- Verify that metrics increment correctly on success and failure.\n- Verify error handling and logging when exceptions occur during cross-sell data population.\n- Verify that existing cart presentation remains unaffected when no cross-sell data is present.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: com/swiggy/api/data/model/cart/presenter/CartPresenter.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, Data model change, Error handling change  \nSummary: Added support for populating cross-sell widget data in the cart response by converting cross-sell suggestions into cart items and integrating them into the cart presentation, along with metrics tracking and error handling.  \nEndpoint/Function: `basicCartPresenter(CartOutput cartOutput, Headers headers)`, `populateCrossSellWidgetData(BaseCart baseCart, Cart cart)`, `convertCrossSellItemToCartMenuItem(List<CrossSellSuggestionV2> crossSellSuggestions)`  \nNew Behavior: When cross-sell suggestion data is available in the base cart, the cart response includes a `crossSellWidgetData` field containing cross-sell tabs and items converted to cart item format; metrics are tracked for success and failure of this population.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `convertCrossSellItemToCartMenuItem`, `CheckoutCustomMetrics.CROSS_SELL_SUGGESTIONS_METRICS.labels().inc()`, `cart.setCrossSellWidgetData()`  \nModified Inputs: `BaseCart.getGetCrossSellSuggestionResponse()` (new data source for cross-sell suggestions)  \nModified Outputs: `Cart.crossSellWidgetData` (new field added to cart response)  \nContext Needed: `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` class structure, `CrossSellSuggestionV2` and related cross-sell data models, `Cart` class changes for crossSellWidgetData field  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Happy path: BaseCart contains cross-sell suggestions; verify cart response includes correctly populated crossSellWidgetData with tabs and items.  \n- Edge case: BaseCart contains empty cross-sell suggestions list; verify cart response has empty or null crossSellWidgetData.  \n- Edge case: BaseCart contains cross-sell tabs with multiple tabs and suggestions; verify all tabs and items are correctly converted and included.  \n- Error case: Simulate exception during cross-sell data processing; verify error is logged and failure metric is incremented.  \n- Verify that when no cross-sell data is present, cart response does not include crossSellWidgetData or it is empty.  \n- Verify price conversion correctness using MoneyUtils.  \n- Verify veg classification mapping from VegClassifier enum to integer flag.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new constant endpoint:\n   - Change: Added a new static final String constant named PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_ENDPOINT with the value "/v13".\n   - Category: API change (new endpoint addition)\n   - Component affected: DspServiceConfig class, specifically the configuration of API endpoints related to cross-sell widgets.\n   - New behavior: This change introduces a new API endpoint path presumably to be used for a "pilled cross-sell widget tabbed" feature or functionality. This suggests an expansion of the DSP service’s cross-sell capabilities with a new endpoint version.\n   - Test implications:\n     * Tests need to verify that this new endpoint is correctly referenced and used where applicable.\n     * Integration tests should confirm that calls to "/v13" behave as expected.\n     * Regression tests should ensure existing endpoints remain unaffected.\n     * If this endpoint corresponds to new or updated business logic, tests should cover the specific behavior behind this endpoint.\n   - Downstream dependencies: None visible in this file; this is a configuration constant only.\n   - Modified inputs: None (no parameters changed)\n   - Modified outputs: None (no return values changed)\n   - Context needed: Other classes or services that consume this endpoint constant, especially any service or controller classes that make HTTP calls or route requests to this endpoint.\n\nNo other changes are present in the diff.\n\nSummary: The change is a simple addition of a new API endpoint constant to the configuration class, enabling support for a new cross-sell widget tabbed feature.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: DspServiceConfig.java  \nChange Type: API change (new endpoint addition)  \nSummary: Added a new API endpoint constant for the pilled cross-sell widget tabbed feature.  \nEndpoint/Function: PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_ENDPOINT ("/v13") in DspServiceConfig  \nNew Behavior: Enables the DSP service to reference and use a new "/v13" endpoint for pilled cross-sell widget tabbed functionality.  \nTest Impact: Medium (new endpoint integration and usage need to be validated)  \nDownstream Dependencies: None visible in this file; likely other service or controller classes that use this constant.  \nModified Inputs: None  \nModified Outputs: None  \nContext Needed: Classes or services that utilize DspServiceConfig endpoints, particularly those handling cross-sell widget API calls.  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify that the new endpoint constant is correctly loaded and accessible.  \n- Integration tests for API calls routed to "/v13" endpoint, verifying expected responses and behavior.  \n- Regression tests to ensure existing endpoints ("/v4", "/v9", "/v6") continue to function correctly.  \n- Edge cases around feature toggling or conditional usage of this new endpoint, if applicable.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new metric counter: CROSS_SELL_SUGGESTIONS_TAB_METRICS\n   - Category: Other (Metrics/Monitoring enhancement)\n   - Component affected: CheckoutCustomMetrics class (metrics collection for cross sell suggestions)\n   - Description: A new Prometheus Counter metric named "cross_sell_suggestions_tab_metrics" has been added. This metric tracks tab metrics for cross sell suggestions, specifically counting the number of items in each tab for both tabbed and fallback non-tabbed UI presentations. It includes two labels: "variant" and "tab".\n   - New Behavior: The system will now collect and expose metrics related to cross sell suggestion tabs, providing insights into item counts per tab variant.\n   - Test Implications:\n     * Verify that the new metric is correctly registered and increments as expected.\n     * Validate that the labels "variant" and "tab" are correctly applied and populated.\n     * Confirm that the metric increments in scenarios where cross sell suggestions tabs are rendered or processed.\n     * Since this is a metrics addition, no direct API or business logic changes are implied, but integration tests for metrics collection and monitoring dashboards might be needed.\n   - Downstream Dependencies: None visible in this file; this is a static metric definition.\n   - Modified Inputs: None (new metric added, no input parameters changed)\n   - Modified Outputs: None (no return values or API responses changed)\n   - Context Needed: The usage context of this metric in the codebase (e.g., where this counter is incremented) to understand triggering scenarios.\n   - Suggested Test Scenarios:\n     * Happy path: Confirm metric increments when cross sell suggestion tabs are displayed/processed.\n     * Edge cases: Validate behavior when variant or tab labels are empty or unexpected.\n     * Metrics registration and exposure correctness.\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CheckoutCustomMetrics.java  \nChange Type: Other (Metrics/Monitoring enhancement)  \nSummary: Added a new Prometheus counter metric to track item counts in cross sell suggestion tabs with variant and tab labels.  \nEndpoint/Function: CheckoutCustomMetrics class (new static Counter: CROSS_SELL_SUGGESTIONS_TAB_METRICS)  \nNew Behavior: The system will track and expose metrics for cross sell suggestion tabs, including item counts per tab and variant, aiding monitoring and analysis of cross sell UI components.  \nTest Impact: Low (metrics addition, no direct functional or API changes)  \nDownstream Dependencies: None visible in this file (metric definition only)  \nModified Inputs: None  \nModified Outputs: None  \nContext Needed: Code locations where CROSS_SELL_SUGGESTIONS_TAB_METRICS is incremented or used to understand operational impact.  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify metric registration and availability in Prometheus metrics endpoint.  \n- Confirm metric increments correctly with appropriate labels during cross sell suggestion tab rendering or processing.  \n- Test label handling with various variant and tab values, including empty or unexpected inputs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nError: Could not get content for file src/main/java/com/swiggy/api/pojo/CMS/crossselling/CrossSellTab.java\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1.

Now, the method also extracts `suggestedItemsWithCategory` which includes item ID, score, and category. If `suggestedItemsWithCategory` is present and non-empty, it is returned instead of the older list.  \n   - Test Implications: Tests must verify correct parsing of both simple item lists and categorized items, and correct prioritization of returning categorized suggestions when available.\n\n3. **Enhanced `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` method**  \n   - Category: Business logic update  \n   - Function: `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob`  \n   - Change: Along with storing a simple list of item IDs, the method now also serializes and stores `suggestedItemsWithCategory` (item ID, category, score) into the DDB blob.  \n   - Test Implications: Tests should verify that the DDB blob correctly serializes both simple and categorized suggested items, and that the TTL and keys are set correctly.\n\n4. **Modification of `generateSuggestionsResponse` method signature and behavior**  \n   - Category: API change, Business logic update  \n   - Function: `generateSuggestionsResponse`  \n   - Change: Added a new parameter `List<CrossSellTab> tabbedSuggestions` and set it in the response object. This adds a new field `crossSellTabs` to the response.  \n   - Test Implications: Tests must verify that the new field is correctly set and returned in the response, and that existing behavior remains unaffected.\n\n5. **Addition of a new overloaded method `getCrossSellSuggestionRequest`**  \n   - Category: Business logic update, API change  \n   - Function: `getCrossSellSuggestionRequest(Headers headers, CartBlob cartBlob)`  \n   - Change: This new method builds a `GetCrossSellSuggestionRequest` object from HTTP headers and a cart blob, extracting and mapping multiple contexts: device, authentication, items, restaurant ID, request context, analytics session context, and location context. It uses utility methods to extract values and sets defaults or empty values where necessary. It also handles exceptions gracefully by logging warnings.  \n   - Test Implications: This is a significant new code path for request creation, requiring tests for correct mapping from headers and cart blob, handling of null/empty values, and exception scenarios. Also, validation of all nested contexts and their fields is needed.\n\n6. **Minor change in `isValidSession` method**  \n   - Category: Business logic update, Security change  \n   - Function: `isValidSession`  \n   - Change: Added redundant parentheses around token equality check; no functional change but could be a code cleanup.  \n   - Test Implications: No new tests needed.\n\n7. **New static imports and utility usage**  \n   - Category: Business logic update  \n   - Change: Use of `Utility.getPlatformFromUserAgent` and other utility methods for extracting platform, device ID, version code, user agent, TID, session info, city ID, request channel, etc.  \n   - Test Implications: Tests should verify that utility methods are correctly integrated and that their outputs are correctly mapped into the request.\n\n8. **Additional null and empty checks with Optional usage**  \n   - Category: Business logic update, Error handling change  \n   - Change: The new request builder method uses Java Optional extensively to avoid null pointer exceptions and to conditionally set fields.  \n   - Test Implications: Tests should verify behavior with missing or partial data in headers and cart blob, ensuring no exceptions and correct defaults.\n\n**Downstream dependencies:**  \n- `Utility.getDeviceId()`, `Utility.getVersionCode()`, `Utility.getUserAgentAsSentFromClient()`,

pk, String sk, int crossSellTtl)` now serializes additional fields.  \n- `generateSuggestionsResponse(boolean allSuggestionsAdded, List<CrossSellSuggestionV2> suggestions, List<CrossSellTab> tabbedSuggestions)` new parameter added.  \n- New method `getCrossSellSuggestionRequest(Headers headers, CartBlob cartBlob)` added.\n\n**Modified outputs/return values:**  \n- `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems` returns a list that may include categorized suggested items.  \n- `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` returns a blob including categorized suggested items.  \n- `generateSuggestionsResponse` returns response including cross-sell tabs.  \n- New request object constructed by `getCrossSellSuggestionRequest(Headers, CartBlob)`.\n\n**Summary of test implications:**  \n- Validate parsing and serialization of categorized suggested items in DDB blobs.  \n- Validate new response field `crossSellTabs` is correctly set and returned.  \n- Validate new request building from headers and cart blob, including all nested contexts and optional fields.  \n- Validate error handling and logging on malformed or incomplete inputs.  \n- Validate backward compatibility with old request/response formats.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CrossSellSuggestionHelper.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, API change, Data model change, Error handling change, Security change  \nSummary: Added support for categorized suggested items in DDB response and blob serialization, introduced cross-sell tabs in response, and implemented a new method to build

Addition of a new overloaded method:\n   - Method: `public static float moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money money)`\n   - Change Type: \n     - API change (new method overload)\n     - Error handling change (try-catch for NumberFormatException)\n   - Description:\n     - This method accepts a different Money class (`com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money`) which appears to have `String` types for units and an `int` for nanos, and converts it into the existing Google Money Proto format before calling the existing `moneyToFloat(Money money)` method.\n     - It includes error handling for `NumberFormatException` when parsing the units string to a long, logging the error and returning 0 in case of failure.\n   - Modified Inputs:\n     - Input parameter changed from `com.google.type.Money` to `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` (new method overload).\n   - Modified Outputs:\n     - Returns a float value representing the monetary amount, or 0 if parsing fails.\n   - Downstream Dependencies:\n     - Calls `moneyToFloat(Money money)` (existing method in the same class).\n     - Calls `Money.newBuilder()` from Google Money Proto.\n     - Uses logging via `log.error`.\n   - Test Implications:\n     - New tests needed to verify correct conversion from `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` to float.\n     - Tests to cover valid inputs (correct string units and nanos).\n     - Tests to cover invalid inputs (non-numeric units string) to verify error handling and that 0 is returned.\n     - Verify that logging occurs on error.\n     - Ensure consistency with existing `moneyToFloat(Money)` behavior.\n     - No changes to existing methods, but regression testing recommended to ensure no side effects.\n   - Additional Notes:\n     - The addition of Lombok\'s `@Slf4j` annotation enables logging, which is new for this class.\n     - No changes to existing business logic or calculations.\n     - No changes to currency code handling or precision.\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: MoneyUtils.java  \nChange Type: API change, Error handling change  \nSummary: Added a new overloaded method to convert a different Money object (`com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money`) to float with error handling for invalid numeric conversion.  \nEndpoint/Function: `moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money money)`  \nNew Behavior: Converts a `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` instance (with String units) to a float by parsing the units string and nanos, returning 0 and logging an error if parsing fails.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `moneyToFloat(Money money)`, `Money.newBuilder()`, logging via `log.error`  \nModified Inputs: Added new method with input parameter of type `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` (units as String, nanos as int)  \nModified Outputs: Returns float value of money amount or 0 on parsing error  \nContext Needed: `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` class definition, existing `moneyToFloat(Money)` method, logging configuration  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Valid `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` with numeric units string and valid nanos → returns correct float value  \n- Invalid `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` with non-numeric units string → returns 0 and logs error  \n- Boundary tests with zero, negative, and large values in units and nanos  \n- Consistency check with existing `moneyToFloat(Money)` method for equivalent values  \n- Verify no exceptions propagate outside the method on invalid input\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new static method `getPlatformFromUserAgent(String userAgent, UserAgentType userAgentType)` in the `Utility` class.\n\n   - Change Type: Business logic update\n   - Endpoint/Function affected: `Utility.getPlatformFromUserAgent`\n   - New Behavior:\n     - The method determines the platform (Android, iOS, Web, Dweb, or Invalid) based on the input parameters `userAgent` (String) and `userAgentType` (UserAgentType enum).\n     - Priority is given to the `userAgent` string to identify Android and iOS platforms.\n     - If the `userAgent` does not correspond to Android or iOS, the method uses `userAgentType` to determine if the platform is MWEB (mapped to PLATFORM_WEB) or DWEB (mapped to PLATFORM_DWEB).\n     - If none of the conditions match, it returns PLATFORM_INVALID.\n   - Modified Inputs:\n     - `userAgent` (String)\n     - `userAgentType` (UserAgentType)\n   - Modified Outputs:\n     - Returns a `Platform` enum value indicating the platform type.\n   - Downstream Dependencies:\n     - Uses `Utility.isNotEmpty` method to check if `userAgent` is not empty.\n     - Uses `UserAgentType` enum\'s `getValue()` method.\n     - Returns values from `Platform` enum.\n   - Test Implications:\n     - New method requires unit tests to verify correct platform determination based on various combinations of `userAgent` and `userAgentType`.\n     - Tests should cover:\n       - `userAgent` values "Swiggy-Android" and "Swiggy-iOS" returning PLATFORM_ANDROID and PLATFORM_IOS respectively.\n       - `userAgent` values other than Android/iOS with `userAgentType` as MWEB and DWEB returning PLATFORM_WEB and PLATFORM_DWEB respectively.\n       - Null or empty `userAgent` and null `userAgentType` returning PLATFORM_INVALID.\n       - Edge cases such as unknown `userAgent` strings and unknown `userAgentType` values.\n     - Since this is a utility method, it may be used downstream in platform-specific logic; testing should verify integration points where this method is called.\n   - Context Needed:\n     - `Platform` enum/class definition (to understand possible platform values).\n     - `UserAgentType` enum/class definition.\n     - Any existing usages of this method or similar platform detection logic in the codebase.\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: Utility.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update  \nSummary: Added a new utility method to determine platform type from user agent string and user agent type enum.  \nEndpoint/Function: `Utility.getPlatformFromUserAgent(String userAgent, UserAgentType userAgentType)`  \nNew Behavior: Returns a platform enum value (PLATFORM_ANDROID, PLATFORM_IOS, PLATFORM_WEB, PLATFORM_DWEB, or PLATFORM_INVALID) based on input user agent string and user agent type.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `Utility.isNotEmpty`, `UserAgentType.getValue()`, `Platform` enum values  \nModified Inputs: `userAgent` (String), `userAgentType` (UserAgentType)  \nModified Outputs: Returns `Platform` enum value  \nContext Needed: `Platform` enum/class, `UserAgentType` enum/class, usages of platform detection logic  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Input userAgent = "Swiggy-Android", userAgentType = null → expect PLATFORM_ANDROID  \n- Input userAgent = "Swiggy-iOS", userAgentType = null → expect PLATFORM_IOS  \n- Input userAgent = "someOtherAgent", userAgentType = MWEB → expect PLATFORM_WEB  \n- Input userAgent = "someOtherAgent", userAgentType = DWEB → expect PLATFORM_DWEB  \n- Input userAgent = null or empty, userAgentType = null → expect PLATFORM_INVALID  \n- Input userAgent = unknown string, userAgentType = unknown enum → expect PLATFORM_INVALID\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of two new test methods related to "Pilled Cross Sell Widget" feature:\n   - getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariantTestForWhitelistedUserIds\n   - getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariantTestForNonWhitelistedUserIds\n\nCategory: Business logic update\n\nComponent affected: FeatureFlagService class, specifically the method getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant (implied, though method implementation is not shown in the diff, tests indicate existence).\n\nNew Behavior:\n- The feature flag service now includes logic to determine the default variant of the "Pilled Cross Sell Widget" based on user whitelist membership.\n- For whitelisted user IDs, the variant returned is a specific constant: PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_VARIANT.\n- For non-whitelisted user IDs, the variant returned is a default value fetched from configuration, with a fallback to "non_tabbed".\n\nTest Implications:\n- New test coverage is added for the user whitelist-based variant selection for the pilled cross sell widget.\n- Tests should verify correct variant is returned for both whitelisted and non-whitelisted user IDs.\n- Edge cases such as empty or null user IDs, or empty whitelist configurations, should be considered (not shown in the diff but implied for completeness).\n- Integration tests or end-to-end tests may need to verify UI behavior or feature toggling based on this variant.\n\nDownstream Dependencies:\n- getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant (method under test)\n- checkoutOptions.getOption (to fetch whitelist and default variant config)\n- FeatureFlagService constants: PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_VARIANT, PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_DEFAULT_VARIANT_DEFAULT_VALUE\n\nModified Inputs:\n- User ID string passed to getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant\n\nModified Outputs:\n- String representing the default variant of the pilled cross sell widget\n\nContext Needed:\n- Implementation of getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant method in FeatureFlagService\n- Constants related to pilled cross sell widget variants in FeatureFlagService\n- Configuration keys: "pilled_cross_sell_widget_enabled_user_ids", "pilled_cross_sell_widget_default_variant"\n\nSuggested Test Scenarios:\n- Verify variant returned is PILLED_CROSS_SELL_WIDGET_TABBED_VARIANT for user IDs in whitelist\n- Verify variant returned is default variant for user IDs not in whitelist\n- Verify behavior when whitelist is empty or null\n- Verify behavior when default variant config is missing or null\n- Verify behavior for null or empty user ID input\n- Verify integration with UI or feature toggling that depends on this variant\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: FeatureFlagServiceTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update  \nSummary: Added tests for user whitelist-based selection of default variant for the pilled cross sell widget feature.  \nEndpoint/Function: FeatureFlagService.getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant  \nNew Behavior: Returns a specific variant for whitelisted users and a default variant for others based on configuration.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: FeatureFlagService.getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant, checkoutOptions.getOption  \nModified Inputs: User ID string parameter to getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant  \nModified Outputs: String variant representing the pilled cross sell widget default variant  \nContext Needed: Implementation of getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant, constants and configuration keys related to pilled cross sell widget  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Whitelisted user ID returns tabbed variant  \n- Non-whitelisted user ID returns default variant  \n- Empty or null whitelist configuration  \n- Missing or empty default variant configuration  \n- Null or empty user ID input  \n- Integration with UI or feature toggling mechanisms\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of import: \n   - Added import for `CrossSellTab` class.\n   - Category: Data model change (new data model class usage).\n   - Implication: Indicates that `CrossSellTab` is now part of the response model and should be tested for presence and correctness.\n\n2. Addition of new test method `cartSuggestionFallbackTest()`:\n   - A new test case was added to test the `cartSuggestionFallback` method of `cartSuggestionController`.\n   - Category: Error handling change (fallback behavior).\n   - Endpoint/Function affected: `cartSuggestionFallback` method in `CartSuggestionController`.\n   - New behavior: When fallback is triggered, the controller returns an empty `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` object.\n   - Test implications: Need to verify fallback behavior returns expected empty response, ensuring graceful degradation when main suggestion service fails.\n   - Inputs: `GetCrossSellSuggestionRequest` (same as existing request mocks).\n   - Outputs: Empty `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` with empty lists for suggestions and tabs, and `allCrossSellSuggestionsAdded` false.\n\n3. Modification in `mockEmptyResponse()` method:\n   - Added initialization of `crossSellTabs` to an empty list in the empty response mock.\n   - Category: Data model change (response schema extended).\n   - Implication: The response model now includes `crossSellTabs` field, which must be accounted for in tests verifying empty or fallback responses.\n   - Outputs: `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` now includes empty `crossSellTabs` list in addition to existing fields.\n\nSummary of key changes:\n- The response model `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` has been extended to include a new field `crossSellTabs` (likely a list of `CrossSellTab` objects).\n- A new fallback method `cartSuggestionFallback` has been introduced in the controller with a corresponding test, which returns an empty response with empty suggestions and tabs.\n- Existing tests for error handling verify that on exceptions, an empty response including empty `crossSellTabs` is returned.\n\nTest implications:\n- Existing tests need to be updated to verify the presence and correctness of the new `crossSellTabs` field in responses.\n- New tests should be added for the fallback method to ensure it returns the correct empty response structure.\n- Tests should verify that in error scenarios, the response includes empty `crossSellTabs`.\n- Tests should verify serialization/deserialization of the new `crossSellTabs` field.\n- Since this is a data model extension and fallback addition, no direct API signature changes are visible here, but the response schema is extended.\n\nDownstream dependencies visible in the file:\n- `cartSuggestionFallback` method of `cartSuggestionController` (new test added).\n- `mockEmptyResponse()` method (modified to include `crossSellTabs`).\n- `cartSuggestions` method (existing tests use it, no change shown here).\n\nModified inputs:\n- No changes to input parameters or request objects.\n\nModified outputs:\n- `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` now includes `crossSellTabs` list in empty and fallback responses.\n\nContext needed for further testing:\n- Implementation of `cartSuggestionFallback` method in `CartSuggestionController` (not shown here).\n- Definition and usage of `CrossSellTab` class and its role in the response.\n- Behavior of `crossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestion()` in relation to `crossSellTabs`.\n- Any other controller methods that populate or use `crossSellTabs`.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CartSuggestionControllerTest.java  \nChange Type:  \n- Data model change (addition of `crossSellTabs` field in response)  \n- Error handling change (addition of fallback method and test)  \n\nSummary:  \nAdded support for a new `crossSellTabs` field in the cross-sell suggestion response and introduced a fallback method in the controller returning an empty response including this new field.  \n\nEndpoint/Function:  \n- `cartSuggestionFallback` method in `CartSuggestionController`  \n- `mockEmptyResponse()` method (test helper)  \n\nNew Behavior:  \nThe controller now supports a fallback method that returns an empty `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` including empty `crossSellTabs`. The response model has been extended to include `crossSellTabs` in empty and fallback responses.  \n\nTest Impact:  \nMedium — requires new tests for fallback behavior and updates to existing tests to verify the presence and correctness of the new `crossSellTabs` field in responses, especially in empty and error scenarios.  \n\nDownstream Dependencies:  \n- `cartSuggestionFallback` method  \n- `mockEmptyResponse()` method  \n- `cartSuggestions` method (existing)  \n\nModified Inputs:  \n- None  \n\nModified Outputs:  \n- `GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse` now includes `crossSellTabs` list in empty and fallback responses.  \n\nContext Needed:  \n- Implementation details of `cartSuggestionFallback` in `CartSuggestionController`  \n- Definition and usage of `CrossSellTab` class  \n- How `crossSellTabs` is populated in normal and fallback scenarios  \n\nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Happy path: Verify normal `cartSuggestions` response includes `crossSellTabs` when populated.  \n- Fallback path: Verify `cartSuggestionFallback` returns empty response with empty `crossSellTabs`.  \n- Error handling: Verify that when `crossSellSuggestionService` throws exceptions, the controller returns an empty response including empty `crossSellTabs`.  \n- Serialization: Verify JSON serialization/deserialization of `crossSellTabs` in responses.  \n- Edge cases: Empty input items, missing contexts, and verify fallback behavior.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of imports related to cross-selling:\n   - New imports added for classes like CatalogItem, CrossSellSuggestionV2, CrossSellTab, PricingInfo, VegClassifier, Money, GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse, SuggestedItemCategory, and CrossSellItemTab.\n   - Category: Data model change (new data structures introduced).\n   - Implication: The system now handles new data models related to cross-selling suggestions and tabs.\n\n2. Addition of multiple new test methods related to cross-selling widget presentation:\n   - testUserCartPresenterForPilledCrossSellWidgetTabbed\n   - testUserCartPresenterForPilledCrossSellWidgetNonTabbed\n   - testUserCartPresenterForPilledCrossSellWidgetNonTabbedNonXp\n   - These tests create mock cross-sell suggestion responses with multiple tabs or non-tabbed suggestions.\n   - They set the XP data for "pilled_cross_sell_widget" to "tabbed" or "non_tabbed" and verify the cart\'s cross-sell widget data accordingly.\n   - Category: Business logic update (handling of cross-sell widget data and XP data integration).\n   - Endpoint/Function affected: userCartPresenter.basicCartPresenter (main cart presentation logic).\n   - New Behavior: The cart presentation now supports rendering cross-sell widgets in tabbed or non-tabbed formats based on XP data and feature flag checks.\n   - The logic also respects a feature flag to skip XP data for pilled cross-sell widgets.\n   - Modified Inputs: BaseCart.getGetCrossSellSuggestionResponse (new cross-sell suggestion data), BaseCart.getXpData (with "pilled_cross_sell_widget" key).\n   - Modified Outputs: Cart.getCrossSellWidgetData (populated with tabs and suggestions), Cart.getXpData (used to determine widget format).\n   - Downstream dependencies: userCartPresenter.basicCartPresenter, featureFlagService.isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped().\n   - Test Implications: High - new data models and logic paths added for cross-sell widgets, requiring tests for tabbed/non-tabbed rendering, XP flag effects, and data correctness.\n\n3. Changes in test assertions:\n   - Assertions check that the cross-sell tabs and suggestions are correctly mapped from the new data structures.\n   - IDs are converted from String to Integer in assertions (e.g., popularCrossSellSuggestionV2.getCatalogItem().getId() is "1" in input but asserted as 1 in output).\n   - This implies a transformation in the presentation layer converting string IDs to integers.\n   - Category: Business logic update (data transformation).\n   - Test Implications: Medium - tests must verify correct data transformation and mapping.\n\nSummary of overall change:\n- Introduction of a new cross-sell widget feature that supports both tabbed and non-tabbed UI presentations.\n- The cart presenter now processes a new cross-sell suggestion response model and populates the cart with cross-sell tabs and suggestions accordingly.\n- Feature flag and XP data control whether the widget is shown and in which format.\n- Tests added to verify these behaviors and data mappings.\n\nNo changes to existing API signatures or error handling were observed in the diff.\n\nNo UI code is shown, but the cross-sell widget data is likely consumed by UI layers.\n\nNo security or performance changes evident.\n\nPotential test implications are mostly around validating new data models, feature flag behavior, XP data influence, and correct population of cart cross-sell widget data.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: BasicCartPresenterTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, Data model change  \nSummary: Added support and tests for a new cross-sell widget feature with tabbed and non-tabbed presentations controlled by XP data and feature flags.  \nEndpoint/Function: userCartPresenter.basicCartPresenter (cart presentation logic)  \nNew Behavior: The cart presenter processes new cross-sell suggestion data structures to populate cross-sell widget data in the cart, supporting tabbed and non-tabbed layouts based on XP data and feature flags.  \nTest Impact: High  \nDownstream Dependencies: userCartPresenter.basicCartPresenter, featureFlagService.isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped()  \nModified Inputs: BaseCart.getGetCrossSellSuggestionResponse (new cross-sell suggestion response), BaseCart.getXpData (with "pilled_cross_sell_widget" key)  \nModified Outputs: Cart.getCrossSellWidgetData (populated cross-sell tabs and suggestions), Cart.getXpData (used for widget format decision)  \nContext Needed: userCartPresenter.basicCartPresenter method implementation, featureFlagService.isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped method, data model classes: GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse, CrossSellTab, CrossSellSuggestionV2, CatalogItem, CrossSellItemTab  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify cart presentation with cross-sell widget in tabbed mode with multiple tabs and suggestions.  \n- Verify cart presentation with cross-sell widget in non-tabbed mode with flat suggestion list.  \n- Verify behavior when XP data indicates skipping the pilled cross-sell widget.  \n- Validate correct mapping and transformation of cross-sell suggestion data (IDs, names, veg classifiers, pricing).  \n- Edge cases: empty cross-sell suggestions, missing tabs, null XP data, feature flag disabled.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new test method `getItemSuggestionWithCategorySuccess()` in `DspServiceTest`:\n   - Category: Business logic update\n   - Description: This test verifies that the `getItemSuggestion` method of `DspService` correctly handles and returns a `SuggestedItem` that includes a new data field `category` along with existing fields `itemId` and `score`.\n   - Implications for testing: Tests must now verify that the `category` field is correctly populated and returned in the response object. This implies the underlying service or client may have been updated to support this new attribute.\n   - Modified outputs: The `ItemSuggestionResponse` now includes `SuggestedItem` objects with an additional `category` field.\n   - Downstream dependencies: `dspClient.getItemSuggestions()`, `dspService.getItemSuggestion()`\n   - Modified inputs: None explicitly changed in the test; mocks still use generic `Mockito.any()` for parameters.\n   - Modified outputs: `ItemSuggestionResponse` now includes `SuggestedItem.category` in addition to `itemId` and `score`.\n\n2. Addition of a new helper method `mockItemSuggestionWithCategoryResponse()`:\n   - Category: Data model change\n   - Description: This method creates a mock `ItemSuggestionResponse` with `SuggestedItem` objects that include the new `category` field set to `"Beverage"`.\n   - Implications for testing: Mock data now reflects the updated data model with category information, enabling tests to validate this new attribute.\n   - Modified outputs: Mock response includes `category` field in `SuggestedItem`.\n\n3. Minor refactoring of `mockItemSuggestionResponse()`:\n   - Category: Other (code style/refactoring)\n   - Description: The method now explicitly sets fields on `SuggestedItem` using setters rather than constructor, aligning with the style used in the new mock method.\n   - Implications for testing: No functional change, but improved consistency in mock object creation.\n\nSummary of overall impact:\n- The core business logic of `DspService.getItemSuggestion()` is expected to handle and return `SuggestedItem` objects that now include a `category` attribute.\n- Tests must be updated or added to verify the presence and correctness of this new field.\n- No changes to API parameters or error handling are evident.\n- No UI or performance changes.\n- The addition suggests an enhancement in the data model and business logic to support item categorization in suggestions.\n\nTesting implications:\n- New tests are required to validate the `category` field in successful responses.\n- Existing tests should be reviewed to ensure they do not break due to the new field.\n- Edge cases where `category` might be null or missing should be tested if applicable.\n- Integration tests may need to confirm that the DSP client and service correctly propagate this new field.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: DspServiceTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, Data model change  \nSummary: Added support and testing for a new `category` field in `SuggestedItem` returned by `getItemSuggestion`.  \nEndpoint/Function: `DspService.getItemSuggestion()`, `DspServiceTest.getItemSuggestionWithCategorySuccess()`  \nNew Behavior: The service now returns suggested items with an additional `category` attribute, allowing consumers to receive item category information alongside item ID and score.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `dspClient.getItemSuggestions()`, `dspService.getItemSuggestion()`  \nModified Inputs: None (test inputs remain generic mocks)  \nModified Outputs: `ItemSuggestionResponse` now includes `SuggestedItem.category` in the response payload  \nContext Needed: `DspService.getItemSuggestion()`, `SuggestedItem` class definition, `DspClient.getItemSuggestions()`  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify successful retrieval of item suggestions including the `category` field (happy path).  \n- Validate behavior when `category` is missing or null in the response.  \n- Confirm existing fields (`itemId`, `score`) remain unaffected.  \n- Test failure scenarios remain unchanged but should be revalidated to ensure no regression.  \n- Integration test to verify end-to-end propagation of the `category` field from client to service to consumer.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of a new static response constant RESPONSE_WITH_CATEGORIES_SUCCESS that includes an additional field "category" for each item in the cross_sell_cart_scores array.\n   - Category: Data model change\n   - Description: The response JSON now can include a "category" attribute per item, which was not present before.\n   - Test implications: Tests need to verify that the client correctly parses and includes the new "category" field when present, and that it handles null or missing categories gracefully.\n   - Modified Outputs: The JSON response now includes "category" fields in the cross_sell_cart_scores list.\n\n2. Modification of the existing test getResponse_Success to expect "category":null for each item in the response.\n   - Category: Data model change\n   - Description: The existing success test now expects the "category" field to be present but null, indicating that the data model has been extended to always include this field, even if empty.\n   - Test implications: Existing tests must be updated to expect the new field, ensuring backward compatibility and correct handling of missing category data.\n\n3. Addition of a new test method getResponseWithCategories_Success that:\n   - Uses the new RESPONSE_WITH_CATEGORIES_SUCCESS stub.\n   - Calls the client with endpoint "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v13" (note the version change from v9 to v13).\n   - Asserts that the response includes the "category" field with non-null values.\n   - Category: API change (endpoint version), Data model change, Business logic update (handling new field)\n   - Description: This test verifies that the client can handle a newer version of the API response which includes categories per item.\n   - Test implications: New tests must validate correct parsing and mapping of the "category" field, and that the client correctly handles the new endpoint version.\n   - Modified Inputs: Endpoint changed from "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v9" to "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v13"\n   - Modified Outputs: Response now includes "category" fields with string values.\n\nSummary of test impact:\n- Existing tests updated to expect the new "category" field as null.\n- New tests added to verify handling of the "category" field with actual values.\n- Tests should cover both old and new API versions to ensure backward compatibility.\n- Tests should verify correct deserialization of the new field and proper error handling if the field is missing or malformed.\n\nDownstream dependencies:\n- client.getItemSuggestions(String endpoint, ItemSuggestionRequest request)\n- ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString(Object)\n\nNo changes were made to error handling, performance, or security in this diff.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: DspClientTest.java  \nChange Type: Data model change, API change  \nSummary: Added support for a new "category" field in item suggestions and introduced a new API version endpoint to handle this enhanced response.  \nEndpoint/Function: DspClient.getItemSuggestions (tested via DspClientTest), endpoints "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v9" and "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v13"  \nNew Behavior: The client now expects and correctly parses an additional "category" attribute per item in the cross_sell_cart_scores list; the new API version v13 returns this enhanced data, while v9 returns null categories.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: DspClient.getItemSuggestions(), ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString()  \nModified Inputs: Endpoint string parameter changed/added ("v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v9" and "v1/predict/cart_cross_sell/v13")  \nModified Outputs: ItemSuggestionResponse now includes a "category" field per item, which can be null or a string value  \nContext Needed: DspClient class (to verify parsing logic for the new "category" field), ItemSuggestionResponse POJO (to confirm data model changes), API specification for v9 and v13 endpoints  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Happy path: successful response from v9 endpoint with null categories  \n- Happy path: successful response from v13 endpoint with non-null categories  \n- Backward compatibility: ensure client handles missing "category" field gracefully  \n- Error handling: malformed "category" field or unexpected data types  \n- Integration test: verify correct deserialization and mapping of the new field in the response object  \n- Version handling: confirm client behavior when switching between v9 and v13 endpoints\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of import and usage of the method `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems` from `CrossSellSuggestionHelper`.\n   - Category: Business logic update\n   - Function affected: `testConvertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` (modified), new test `testConvertDdbResponseToSuggestedItemsWithCategory` added.\n   - New behavior: The serialization format of suggested items in the DDB blob now includes an additional JSON field `suggestedItemsWithCategory` which holds detailed suggested items with their `item_id`, `score`, and `category` fields. The test for `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` was updated to assert this new enriched JSON structure.\n   - The new test `testConvertDdbResponseToSuggestedItemsWithCategory` verifies that the method `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems` correctly parses this enriched JSON back into a list of `SuggestedItem` objects, including category information.\n   - Modified Inputs: The input to `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` remains the same (a list of `SuggestedItem`), but the output JSON structure now contains additional detailed information.\n   - Modified Outputs: The JSON string returned by `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` now includes the `suggestedItemsWithCategory` array with detailed objects.\n   - Downstream Dependencies: `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob`, `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems`.\n   - Test implications: \n     - Existing tests for serialization need to be updated to expect the enriched JSON structure.\n     - New tests are required to verify deserialization from the new JSON format, including category fields.\n     - Edge cases where categories might be null or non-null should be tested.\n     - Validation of correct ordering and mapping of items in both serialization and deserialization.\n     - Backward compatibility or handling of older JSON formats (if applicable) should be considered.\n   - This change impacts the business logic around how suggested items are serialized/deserialized for storage or communication, adding category metadata.\n\nNo other changes to business logic, API, or data models were observed in the diff.\n\nSummary:\n- The main functional change is the enhancement of the suggested items serialization format to include category information and the addition of a corresponding deserialization method test.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CrossSellSuggestionHelperTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update  \nSummary: Enhanced serialization and deserialization of suggested items to include category metadata in the JSON representation.  \nEndpoint/Function: `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob`, `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems`, and their corresponding test methods `testConvertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` and `testConvertDdbResponseToSuggestedItemsWithCategory`.  \nNew Behavior: Suggested items are now serialized into a JSON string that includes both a simple list of item IDs and a detailed list with item IDs, scores, and categories; deserialization correctly reconstructs the detailed suggested items list including categories.  \nTest Impact: Medium - existing serialization tests need updating, and new deserialization tests must be added; tests should cover category presence/absence and correct mapping of fields.  \nDownstream Dependencies: `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob`, `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems`  \nModified Inputs: None (input to serialization remains a list of SuggestedItem objects)  \nModified Outputs: JSON string format of suggested items now includes `suggestedItemsWithCategory` with detailed item info including category.  \nContext Needed: Implementation of `convertSuggestedItemsToDdbBlob` and `convertDdbResponseToSuggestedItems` methods in `CrossSellSuggestionHelper` class.  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Serialization of suggested items with null categories.  \n- Serialization of suggested items with non-null categories.  \n- Deserialization of JSON with detailed suggested items including categories.  \n- Deserialization of JSON missing the `suggestedItemsWithCategory` field (backward compatibility).  \n- Verification of order preservation in serialization and deserialization.  \n- Handling of empty suggested items lists.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of Cross-Sell Tabbed UI Support and Logic:\n   - Category: Business logic update, UI change\n   - A new concept of "CrossSellTab" and "SuggestedItemCategory" has been introduced and integrated into the cross-sell suggestion service.\n   - Multiple new tests have been added to verify the tabbed cross-sell suggestion behavior, including scenarios where:\n     - Tabs are shown when they have one or more items.\n     - Tabs are not shown if items are unavailable or if tabs have fewer than or equal to one item.\n     - Tabs are removed if their items overlap with popular items.\n     - Fallback to non-tabbed approach occurs under certain conditions (e.g., insufficient items in tabs, removal of tabs due to overlap).\n     - Sorting of items within tabs based on scores.\n   - The new behavior involves grouping cross-sell suggestions into tabs based on categories (like Dessert, Beverage, Side), and conditionally showing or hiding these tabs depending on item availability, count, and overlap with popular items.\n   - The response model now includes a list of CrossSellTabs (`crossSellTabs`), in addition to the existing crossSellSuggestions list.\n   - The mockDspResponse method was updated to include category information for SuggestedItems.\n   - The mockEmptyResponse method now initializes an empty list of CrossSellTabs.\n   - Feature flags related to "pilledCrossSellWidget" and default variant ("tabbed") are used to enable this new behavior.\n   - Downstream dependencies include:\n     - dspService.getItemSuggestion()\n     - cmsService.getMenuItems()\n     - availabilityService.getRegularItemAvailability()\n     - crossSellSuggestionRepository.get() and save()\n     - xpPlatformUtil methods for attributes and config\n   - Inputs modified: The request now can include multiple items with categories, and feature flags influence behavior.\n   - Outputs modified: The response now includes `crossSellTabs` with grouped suggestions.\n   - Testing implications:\n     - High impact: New UI grouping logic requires extensive testing of tab creation, filtering, fallback behavior, and sorting.\n     - Need to test feature flag toggling and its effect on tabbed vs non-tabbed responses.\n     - Test item availability impact on tab visibility.\n     - Test overlap with popular items and its effect on tab removal.\n     - Test sorting of items within tabs by score.\n     - Test fallback scenarios when tabs are removed or have insufficient items.\n     - Test response structure includes new `crossSellTabs` field.\n     - Validate behavior with different combinations of item categories and availability.\n     - Verify integration with DSP and CMS services with respect to categories.\n     - Verify that existing non-tabbed behavior remains intact when tabbed is disabled or fallback occurs.\n\n2. Minor Data Model Change:\n   - Category: Data model change\n   - Addition of CrossSellTab and SuggestedItemCategory imports and usage.\n   - The response model now includes a new field `crossSellTabs` (list of CrossSellTab).\n   - The mockEmptyResponse method initializes this new field.\n   - This is a backward-compatible addition but requires validation in tests to ensure the new field is handled correctly.\n\n3. Updates to Mock Data for DSP Responses:\n   - Category: Business logic update\n   - SuggestedItem now includes a category field (e.g., "Dessert", "Beverage", "Side").\n   - This affects how suggestions are grouped and displayed in tabs.\n   - Tests now mock DSP responses with categorized SuggestedItems to verify tabbed behavior.\n\nSummary of test impact:\n- The major change is the introduction of a tabbed cross-sell suggestion UI and logic, controlled via feature flags.\n- The service behavior changes significantly when the tabbed variant is enabled, including grouping, filtering, and fallback logic.\n- The response structure includes a new field for tabs.\n- Tests must cover multiple scenarios around tab visibility, item availability, category overlaps, sorting, and fallback.\n- Existing tests for non-tabbed behavior remain relevant but should be verified to coexist with new tabbed logic.\n\nFunctions called by changed code (downstream dependencies):\n- dspService.getItemSuggestion()\n- cmsService.getMenuItems()\n- availabilityService.getRegularItemAvailability()\n- crossSellSuggestionRepository.get()\n- crossSellSuggestionRepository.save()\n- xpPlatformUtil.getAttributes()\n- xpPlatformUtil.getXPDataForConfig()\n- sessionService.getSessionData()\n\nModified inputs/parameters:\n- GetCrossSellSuggestionRequest now includes multiple items with categories.\n- Feature flags: isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped(), getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant() influence behavior.\n\nModified outputs/return values:\n- GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse now includes `crossSellTabs` (List<CrossSellTab>) in addition to existing crossSellSuggestions.\n- crossSellTabs contain grouped suggestions by category with filtering and sorting applied.\n\nContext needed for further analysis:\n- CrossSellSuggestionService class implementation (especially getCrossSellSuggestion method)\n- CrossSellTab and SuggestedItemCategory class definitions\n- FeatureFlagService methods related to pilledCrossSellWidget\n- DSP service response handling and mapping logic\n- CMS service menu items structure and filtering\n- AvailabilityService item availability logic\n\nSuggested test scenarios:\n- Happy path: Tabbed cross-sell suggestions returned with multiple tabs, each with multiple available items.\n- Tabs with all items unavailable should not be shown; fallback to non-tabbed suggestions.\n- Tabs with only one or zero items should not be shown; fallback to non-tabbed suggestions.\n- Tabs with items overlapping popular items should be removed.\n- If removal of tabs due to overlap results in fewer than minimum tabs, fallback to non-tabbed suggestions.\n- Sorting of items within tabs by score.\n- Feature flag off: no tabs, only non-tabbed suggestions.\n- DSP service failures or empty responses with tabbed variant enabled.\n- CMS service returns empty or null menu items.\n- Availability service marks some items unavailable.\n- Verify response includes crossSellTabs field correctly populated or empty.\n- Verify fallback logic triggers correctly in edge cases.\n- Verify addon groups and other item details remain intact in tabbed suggestions.\n- Verify that existing non-tabbed tests still pass when tabbed variant is disabled.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CrossSellSuggestionServiceTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, UI change, Data model change  \nSummary: Introduces tabbed cross-sell suggestion grouping by item category with conditional tab visibility and fallback to non-tabbed suggestions.  \nEndpoint/Function: CrossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestion() and its test class CrossSellSuggestionServiceTest  \nNew Behavior: Cross-sell suggestions are grouped into tabs based on item categories when enabled via feature flags; tabs are conditionally shown or hidden based on item availability, count, and overlap with popular items; fallback to non-tabbed suggestions occurs when tabs are insufficient or removed.  \nTest Impact: High  \nDownstream Dependencies: dspService.getItemSuggestion(), cmsService.getMenuItems(), availabilityService.getRegularItemAvailability(), crossSellSuggestionRepository.get(), crossSellSuggestionRepository.save(), xpPlatformUtil.getAttributes(), xpPlatformUtil.getXPDataForConfig(), sessionService.getSessionData()  \nModified Inputs: GetCrossSellSuggestionRequest.items with categories, feature flags (isPilledCrossSellWidgetXpSkipped, getPilledCrossSellWidgetDefaultVariant)  \nModified Outputs: GetCrossSellSuggestionResponse.crossSellTabs (List<CrossSellTab>) added alongside existing crossSellSuggestions  \nContext Needed: CrossSellSuggestionService class (getCrossSellSuggestion method), CrossSellTab and SuggestedItemCategory classes, FeatureFlagService methods for pilledCrossSellWidget, DSP service response processing, CMSService menu item handling, AvailabilityService availability logic  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify tabbed suggestions with multiple tabs and items (happy path)  \n- Verify tabs hidden when items unavailable or count ≤ 1, fallback to non-tabbed  \n- Verify tabs removed if items overlap popular items, and fallback if tabs < min count  \n- Verify sorting of items within tabs by score  \n- Verify behavior when feature flags disable tabbed variant  \n- Verify handling of DSP, CMS, and availability service failures or empty responses  \n- Verify response structure includes crossSellTabs correctly  \n- Verify addon groups and item details in tabbed suggestions  \n- Verify fallback logic correctness in edge cases\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of CrossSellSuggestionService mock and initialization in CartServiceImplTest:\n   - Category: Business logic update\n   - Description: The test class CartServiceImplTest now includes a mock for CrossSellSuggestionService and sets up a default behavior for its getCrossSellSuggestionsAsync method to return a completed future with null.\n   - Implications for testing:\n     - Tests involving cart updates or creations might now implicitly depend on cross-sell suggestion logic being invoked asynchronously.\n     - Although the current tests do not explicitly verify interactions with crossSellSuggestionService, the presence of this mock suggests that the production code (CartServiceImpl) may have been updated to call this service.\n     - Test coverage should be extended to verify that cross-sell suggestions are requested appropriately during cart operations.\n     - Error handling and fallback scenarios for the cross-sell service should be tested if applicable.\n   - Downstream dependencies:\n     - crossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestionsAsync()\n   - Modified inputs/outputs:\n     - No direct changes in method signatures or return types in the test code.\n     - Indirectly, cart update/create flows may now trigger cross-sell suggestion fetching.\n   - Context needed:\n     - CartServiceImpl class implementation to confirm where and how crossSellSuggestionService is used.\n     - CrossSellSuggestionService interface and implementation details.\n     - Any changes in CartServiceImpl methods related to cart update/create flows.\n\nSummary:\nOnly one change is present in the diff: the addition of a mock for CrossSellSuggestionService and its initialization in the test setup. This indicates a new asynchronous call to fetch cross-sell suggestions integrated into the cart service logic, which requires corresponding test coverage to ensure proper invocation and handling.\n\nNo API, data model, UI, error handling, or security changes are evident from the diff. The change is purely a business logic integration of a new service call within the cart update/create flows.\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: CartServiceImplTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update  \nSummary: Added integration of CrossSellSuggestionService to asynchronously fetch cross-sell suggestions during cart operations.  \nEndpoint/Function: CartServiceImpl (specifically cart update and create operations tested in CartServiceImplTest)  \nNew Behavior: Cart service now triggers asynchronous fetching of cross-sell suggestions via CrossSellSuggestionService during cart updates or creations.  \nTest Impact: Medium (new service integration requires validation of invocation, handling of async results, and error scenarios)  \nDownstream Dependencies: crossSellSuggestionService.getCrossSellSuggestionsAsync()  \nModified Inputs: None directly in test methods; possible implicit addition in cart update/create flows  \nModified Outputs: None directly in test methods; possible side effects in cart response or state  \nContext Needed:  \n- CartServiceImpl class source code to identify where crossSellSuggestionService is invoked  \n- CrossSellSuggestionService interface and implementation  \n- Any changes in cart update/create methods related to cross-sell suggestions  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Verify that cross-sell suggestions are requested asynchronously during cart creation and update flows  \n- Validate behavior when cross-sell suggestions are successfully fetched (e.g., response enrichment or state update)  \n- Test fallback or error handling when cross-sell suggestion fetching fails or times out  \n- Confirm no regression in existing cart update/create functionality without cross-sell suggestions  \n- Performance impact of asynchronous cross-sell fetching on cart operations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<change_analysis>\n1. Addition of the test method `moneyToFloatTest()`:\n   - Category: Business logic update\n   - Function/component affected: `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money)`\n   - New behavior: Validates that the utility method `moneyToFloat` correctly converts a `Money` object (with currency code, units as string, and nanos) into a float representation of the monetary value.\n   - Inputs: A `Money` object with currency code "INR", units "12", and nanos 340000000.\n   - Outputs: A float value 12.34f.\n   - Test implications: Requires verification that the conversion logic from the `Money` POJO to float is accurate and consistent with the expected monetary value. This is a new functionality test, so new test coverage is needed.\n\n2. Addition of the test method `moneyToFloatExceptionTest()`:\n   - Category: Error handling change\n   - Function/component affected: `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money)`\n   - New behavior: Tests that the `moneyToFloat` method throws a `NumberFormatException` when the `units` field of the `Money` object is an empty string.\n   - Inputs: A `Money` object with currency code "INR", units as an empty string `""`, and nanos 0.\n   - Outputs: Exception thrown (`NumberFormatException`).\n   - Test implications: This introduces an error handling scenario that must be tested to ensure the method correctly handles invalid input and throws the expected exception. This is a negative test case that complements the positive conversion test.\n\nSummary of changes:\n- New test coverage added for the `moneyToFloat` method in `MoneyUtils`.\n- Tests both normal conversion and exception scenarios.\n- No changes to existing methods or APIs; purely additive test cases.\n- The `moneyToFloat` method is assumed to be a new or existing utility method converting a POJO `Money` object to a float monetary value.\n\nDownstream dependencies:\n- `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money)` is the key function under test.\n- The `Money` POJO class from `com.swiggy.api.pojo` is used as input.\n\nModified inputs:\n- New test inputs involving `Money` objects with specific fields (currency code, units string, nanos).\n\nModified outputs:\n- Return float value representing money.\n- Exception thrown on invalid input.\n\nTest implications:\n- New test scenarios must be added for both successful conversion and exception handling.\n- Validation of correct float conversion precision.\n- Validation of exception type and message on invalid input.\n\nContext needed:\n- Implementation details of `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat`.\n- Definition of `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` class.\n- Existing tests or usages of `moneyToFloat` if any.\n\nSuggested test scenarios:\n- Happy path: Convert valid `Money` object with non-empty units and nanos to float.\n- Edge case: Convert `Money` object with zero nanos.\n- Error case: Convert `Money` object with empty or invalid units string, expect `NumberFormatException`.\n- Boundary case: Very large or very small monetary values.\n- Currency code variations (if applicable).\n\n</change_analysis>\n\nFile: MoneyUtilsTest.java  \nChange Type: Business logic update, Error handling change  \nSummary: Added tests for the `moneyToFloat` method to verify correct float conversion from a `Money` POJO and to ensure proper exception handling when invalid input is provided.  \nEndpoint/Function: `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat(com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money)`  \nNew Behavior: Converts a `Money` object to a float value representing the monetary amount; throws `NumberFormatException` if the units string is invalid.  \nTest Impact: Medium  \nDownstream Dependencies: `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat`  \nModified Inputs: `Money` object with fields `currencyCode`, `units` (string), `nanos` (int)  \nModified Outputs: float monetary value, or exception (`NumberFormatException`)  \nContext Needed: `MoneyUtils.moneyToFloat` implementation, `com.swiggy.api.pojo.Money` class definition  \nSuggested Test Scenarios:  \n- Valid conversion from `Money` to float (e.g., "12" units and 340000000 nanos → 12.34f)  \n- Exception thrown when units string is empty or non-numeric  \n- Conversion with zero nanos  \n- Conversion with boundary values (large/small amounts)  \n- Handling of different currency codes (if relevant)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'"""
